Summary: A platform for running experiments created with OpenSesame in web browsers.

At the moment I'm mainly involved in assisting the development of [OpenSesame](http://osdoc.cogsci.nl): An open-source experiment builder for the social sciences. 

Our current project is the development of OpenSesame Online, which is a runtime for experiments created with OpenSesame that enables them to be run in a web browser. 

This project is very actively developed, and hopefully I there is more to show soon. In the meantime, this youtube video made by [Sebastiaan Math√¥t](http://cogsci.nl/smathot) should give a nice impression of what's coming:
